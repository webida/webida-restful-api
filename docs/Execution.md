# WebidaRestfulApi.Execution

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | unique identifier of execution, to demux response stream or cancel request. async exec request should have id, always. For synchronous execution, missing id will be generated by server with random string &amp; timestamp.  | [optional] 
**command** | **String** | command to run. should not contain any arguments, pipes, redirections  | 
**args** | **[String]** | the arguments array | 
**cwd** | **String** | Current working directory of spawned process, relative to workspace root. If abscent, cwd will be the workspace root directory. Does not accept any evaluatable form like $HOME, %USERPROFILE%. As wfs operations, path should be unixified. But, unlikely, while the wfs operations cut heading \&quot;/\&quot; in path with URI normlization, this operation does not convert path to relateive and returns error for the argument.  | [optional] 
**input** | **String** | input string for child process. if falsy, no input will be available to child. (interactive execution via websocket is not supported for most of such processes  requires tty, not standard i/o)  | [optional] 
**timeout** | **Integer** | The value which In \&quot;milliseconds\&quot; the maximum amount of time the child is allowed to run. (not idle time of stdout / stderr stream) if undefined, server sets default timeout value 5 min to synchronous execution requests. If request specifies async execution and sets this value to falsy, server should not kill the child process until   1) The process exists by self   2) cancel operation is invoked by api request   3) The workspace executing the process is removed by api request   4) Server Stops Terminiating any \&quot;too-long-lived\&quot; child process are not graceful, as cancel() is.  | [optional]
