# webida-restful-api

This project contains 
 - Webida Restful API Spec [swagger.yaml](api-spec/swagger.yaml) 
 - Javascript Client code generator (see builder/ directory) using [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:
 - Generated Javascript Client sources & [docs](README-API.md) 
    
## Installation 

### For Webida server & node.js env. 

Since server has a dependency to webida-resftul-api package already, server developers may not need to install npm package manually. To use client in other project,
``` shell
npm install webida-restful-api
```

### For Webida client 

This project contains already built api-bunldle.js that can be used as AMD module. So, just import api-bundle.js (and api-bundle.js.map) to client code directly, or add respository to bower.json. 

In the case of electron, using node modules in any webida client code is not recommended. Use api-bundle.js directly for better performance & integrity. 


## For contributors 

If you found any bugs/problems in api spec, fill free to report. To extend features, pile an issue and begin discussion. All contributions for builder script & templates are always welcome. Please, read sections below to change spec & generate client codes. 


## Build for your own

If you're building webida-based product or service, you may want to customize api spec & regenerate client sources & docs. 

### Pre-requisites

#### node.js

Download & install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) first, if you don't have one yet.
For Windows OS, we recommend to use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) then official installer.

#### swagger-codegen

Download or build swagger-codegen-cli.jar from Swagger Codegen project. See [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project page for details. Then, copy swagger-codegen.cli to builder/ directory. To change the path of jar file, you should edit build.sh directly. 

#### webpack

Just install webpack to global. (unlike grunt/gulp, local installation is not mandatory yet)
``` shell
npm install -g webpack
```

#### bash

For Windows, use bash from git-for-windows binary to run build.sh 

### Editing swagger spec & templates

Use any editor for swagger.yaml file. We recommend you to use swagger editor. Be sure that swagger.yaml is validated before building. Or, code generator will produce very weird errors, hard to find why & where.

Don't forget to change title & description in spec file to avoid collision from other products or services born from same spec. You may have to edit template files, especially package.mustache to change package information built. You should change build.sh to include proper options related to package name and version.

### Building sources & docs

build.sh will clear pre-generated sources & docs with prior swagger.yaml and regenerate them.
``` shell
cd builder
./build.sh
```

### Distributing generated stuffs 

git_push.sh, generated by swagger-codegen, will help you to upload files to git repository. To publish in public package repositories, read & follow instructions of the package system/manager. You may need to upload all generated stuffs to github or some other central code repository.
